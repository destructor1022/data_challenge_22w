# DALI Data Challenge

## Part 1 
All of the information related to this part is under the Part 1 folder. There is the dataset, R code, and an explanation Word document. The R code is just using simple transformations on the data (at most a few steps) to generate graphs of important aspects of the graphs.


## Part 2
All of the information related to this part is in the Part 2 folder. This is my statistical analysis of language prediction of books. I explain most of what is happening in the Word document. The R code is full of comments to explain every step of the process.
